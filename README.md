## üåç Renewable Energy Efficiency Dashboard
This interactive dashboard provides insights into global energy efficiency, renewable energy adoption, CO‚ÇÇ emissions, and population trends over time.
It aims to help users understand the relationship between sustainability metrics across countries and years.

## Data Preparation
- Extracted Data from the years 1990-2000 for the following datasets.
- cleaned and prepared the data using pandas

## üìÅ Dataset Sources
1. https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/co-emissions-per-capita
2. https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/renewable-share-energy
3. https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/energy-intensity
4. https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population

 ## How to Use the Dashboard

1. Open the dashboard in Looker Studio . https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/de39c0fa-ba2e-4066-b70c-e1a05f6bee84
3. Use slicers or filters to explore data by year or country.
4. Hover over graphs for detailed tooltips (year, exact values).

## üí° Insights & Observations

- Some countries with high renewable % still emit large amounts of CO‚ÇÇ due to industrial activity.
- Energy efficiency has generally improved globally, but disparities remain across regions.
- Population growth directly impacts total energy demand but not always per capita efficiency.

## Tech Stack
- Python - pnadas, Looker stuido for Visualization and Dashboard creation.
